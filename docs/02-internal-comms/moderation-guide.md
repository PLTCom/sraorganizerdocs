# Moderation Guidelines
Any internal platform with more than a few people will need moderation, especially a platform containing multiple tendencies from across the left. It is important to remember that while leftists can and should collaborate on mutual goals, there are very real differences between tendencies, groups, and individuals with regards to tactics, beliefs, and temperments.

## Technical Requirements
Moderation is impossible without the proper technical solution for communication.

### Technical Considerations
1. Number of people
2. Required secrecy
3. Required anonymity
4. Moderation tools
    1. Can you temporarily ban/block/mute?
    2. Can people be effectively banned at all? (e.g. could they rejoin under a new name/alias)
