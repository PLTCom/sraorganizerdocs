# Vetting

## Chapter Level
Due to the disconnected nature of the SRA, chapter vetting is the primary place to secure our membership.

### Process Overview
1. Pull the candidate into a regional communication platform, but locked out of sensitive channels.
2. Meet the candidate in person and interview them.
3. If approved as a full member (process varies by chapter), do a hands on gun briefing. This may be familiaraization for some, or just a check for others.

### Welcome Interview
Interview each candidate member in person. This should be done with two full members. The purpose here is to get an initial feel for the candidate, as well as to introduce the chapter and handle any questions about the SRA's mission and organization.

#### Sample Questions

Welcome to the \<Insert Chapter\> Chapter of the SRA!!! Before we hit the range and get into chapter events, we would like to know more about yourself. 

1. Preferred name and pronouns?
2. Where are you (approximate county/district)? No need for a specific address, this is just for us to coordinate for local events.
3. How did you come to join a socialist org, specifically the SRA?
   1. Remind them that we are not a milita or a cult, we are an educational organization. 
   2. Remind them that we don't have to discuss ideology or stuff that usually leads to infighting.
   3. Have you read the chapter bylaws? Do you have any questions or concerns?
   4. What do you hope to get out of the SRA?
4. What is your experience and comfort level with firearms?
    1. What types and calibers?
    2. Do you own any? No need for a list of your arsenal, just curious about experience levels.
    3. Do you need guidance in purchasing or carrying one?
5. Do you feel you can offer any skills or knowledge to the chapter? What kinds of things do you like to do, organize/train/etc? What causes are you interested in?
    1. Maybe talk about ongoing chapter projects (Firearm Safety class, Urban Preparedness, Legislative Action, community cleanup)

## National Level
One of the issues identified in the 2019 National election is that a lack of vetting infrastructure and interconnectivity between chapters means that anyone can join and immediately run for high office. Several proposals have been discussed, including mandating membership in an approved chapter, background checks, and more.
