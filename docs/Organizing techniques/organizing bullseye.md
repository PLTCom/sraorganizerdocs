# The Organizing Bullseye
As organizers, we should be constantly gauging the engagement of the people in our organizaton. Understanding how much energy a person can contribute to a project allows you to best utilize your comrade's time and resources, while also preventing frustration on your end by clearly mapping a person's commitment. A useful tool in visualizing the engagement of people participating in your organization or campaign is the organizing bullseye.

The bullseye is made of 5 distinct areas. _Note, there are many names given to each of the areas in the bullseye. The names used here are used to describe the graphic._ Starting from the center, these are core, active member, inactive member, general public, and hostile. As you move in towards the center, members become more active in your campaign, eventually moving into the "core", where they are invested enough to create their own projects and campaigns. The goal of every organizer should be to try and move members as close to the core as they are comfortable with. 

## The Core
Members in the core are the most involved members. These are the people at every meeting, on every phone call, and leading every event. They are also, probably, the people reading and writing this guide. Members in the core need not be the most technically skilled, the most versed in theory, or the person with the most connections. The aforementioned qualities help, but as long as people in the core listen to other members and members in the community, deficits in other areas are less detrimental. Core members will be the ones that put the bulk of the work into a campaign, putting things together behind the scenes and working out the details to make sure things go smoothly and are typically defined as "leaders". There's no reason why people outside of the core cannot do tasks that typically fall to "leaders" or people in the core-in fact, it's a good idea to hand those tasks off to active members who show potential to move into the core as to introduce them to tools that make organizing easier. However, by its nature the core is a small. The core is composed of people with the most time and the most passion for a project, and as an orgainzer it's important to understand that not everyone can live and breathe your campaign and that's ok. The core should **NEVER** be exclusive, but people should not be forced into the core if they're incapabale of the committment required.

## Active Members
When thinking about who in your organization falls into the category of active member, think of the people who you look to as capable leaders but don't hold an official position or take the lead on projects. Active members are more than capable of performing the duties of core members, and in many cases are the people you think of first to help organize projects. They may not have the time, energy, or skill set (ie they don't think they can lead, but everyone else can see that they're capable)


## Inactive Members

## The General Public

## Hostile groups

## Moving people through the bullseye
Be slow, be specific on your asks, use one-on-ones, understand people's limits and other commitments
